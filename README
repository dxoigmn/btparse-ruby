btparse-ruby
============

btparse-ruby is a ruby wrapper for btparse.

    http://www.gerg.ca/software/btOOL/

For now, btparse-ruby ignores comments, preambles, and strings. It does, 
however, expand strings with macros. There are also methods to split author
lists and purify strings.

Example Usage
-------------

    require 'btparse-ruby'

    entries = BibTeX.parse(file)

    entries.each do |entry|
      puts entry.type
      puts entry.key

      entry.fields.each do |name, value|
        puts "  #{name} = #{value}"
      end
    end
